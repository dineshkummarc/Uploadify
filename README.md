[Integralist](http://www.integralist.co.uk/) - Uploadify
================================

Description
-----------

[Uploadify](http://www.uploadify.com/) is a jQuery plugin to help make it easier to upload multiple files using the Adobe Flash Player.

My colleague helped remove the dependancy on jQuery and we switched it over to plain-vanilla JavaScript as on most projects we end up using my own [Standardizer library](https://github.com/Integralist/Stand.ard.iz.er).

TODO
----

* Clean-up the code
* Remove the majority of features from the Standardizer build we're using (about 98% of it isn't needed).
